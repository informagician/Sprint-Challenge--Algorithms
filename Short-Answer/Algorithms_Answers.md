## Exercise I

a) for given n, loop runs n times before the condition is met. therefore O.time(n)

a as the stored variable is updated each time. therefore O.space(c)


b) for given n, i iterates n times, and everytime j starts at 1, therefore at every iteration of i, j*2 is equal to 2. for any n greater than 1 the while loop runs n times. therefore:
O.time(n)
at each iteration, stored variables (sum, j) get updated, therefore:
O.space(2c) -> O.space(c)


c) for given number of bunnies, function recurses equal times therefore:
O.time(n)

for given number of bunnies, recursion stores and return the number of recursions each time, therefore:
O.space(n)
